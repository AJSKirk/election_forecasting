# Data parsing

Usage `python parse.py -i raw/state.json -o parsed/state.csv -p D -p R` for Dem and Repub run

Raw data can be found as a JSON string at the bottom of the source of the 538 elections page (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/), I haven't included it in the repo for copyright reasons
